        <h1>Instructions</h1>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This is a website that will calculate your GPA (Grade Point Average) for you. All you need to do is input some information and we will do the rest! For more in-depth instructions, follow steps 1 through 4 to learn how to calculate your GPA.</p>
        <h2 class="title">1. Choose Your Semester</h2>
        <p>This is an optional step if you do not wish to save your information for later viewing. Using the dropdown (circled in the image below), input your current year in High School as well as the semester you are currently in.</p>

        <h2 class="title">2. Add Your Current Courses</h2>
        <p>After choosing your semester, input information about your current courses in the text boxes (circled in the image below). For each course, input the course name, the grade you received in that course, and the type of course. The type of course can be AP (for Advanced Placement), Honors, or Regular. An example of a valid input would be a course name of "Pre-Calculus" with a grade of "B-" and type of "Honors".</p>

        <h2 class="title">3. Add a Semester</h2>
        <p>Once you have inputted all the courses for a single semester, you may add another semester and follow steps 1-3 again to fill it out with the correct information. To add an additional semester, click on the "Add Semester" button circled in the image below.</p>

        <h2 class="title">4. Save Your Results</h2>
        <p>In the boxes to the right of the calculator (circled in the image below), you will see your Weighted and Unweighted GPA across all semesters. If you would like to save this information, click the "Save To Transcript" button (also circled in the image below) to have your information available when you visit the "Four Year Plan" page. However, you must meet certain criteria before your information will be saved: you must have filled out every text box, you must have added exactly 7 courses in each semester, and you may not save more than 8 semesters.</p>

        <h2 class="title">Extracurriculars</h2>
        <p>This page in our website gives you a place to store all the extracurriculars you have completed, keeping track of your progress and your goals. To save your extracurriculars, input activities into the corresponding textbox (circled in the image below), input the current state and goal state for your activity, and input your progress. Once finished, you may click "Save Extracurriculars" to save your information for the next time you visit our site.</p>
